<P>More about Hackbright Academy:  Hackbright Academy is an intensive software engineering school for women. Highly driven and accomplished women come to Hackbright to "pivot" in their careers.  </P>
<P>They complete a full-time, in-person, 12-week, 500-hour boot camp rooted in the programming language of Python with the focus of learning full-stack web application development. Fellows learn JavaScript as a secondary programming language as well as HTML/CSS and the templating language Jinja. Fellows learn software development techniques and technologies such as AJAX, *nix command-line, and how to work with APIs such as Google Maps and Twitter.</P>
<P>They learn the fundamentals of Computer Science data structures such as linked lists, dictionaries and trees, as well as object-oriented design. They also learn the fundamentals of basic networking concepts and how the internet works including the HTTP internet protocol. Techniques used in the industry such as pair programming, Git and version control, and deploying to cloud services such as Heroku are also components of the program.</P>
<P>Students learn how to write unit-tests, integration tests, and functional tests for their code, and many also explore Test-Driven Development techniques. To manage database structures, they learn SQL. In object-oriented design they learn how to master Object Relational Mapping techniques with the SQLAlchemy library. Lastly, they use a virtual machine technology called Vagrant in order to access a consistent development environment running Ubuntu, a distribution of the Linux operating system. Can’t believe they learn all this in 12 intensive weeks?</P>
<P>Be our guest, meet the engineers, learn about what they've accomplished, and enjoy the evening!</P></div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Women-in-Data/events/250925231/ target=blank>Breaking into Data Science </a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> June 20, 2018</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Keri Kalmbach has a deep foundation in data science developed in the rigors of the healthcare and consulting domains.

<P>The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP), Module IV requires that risk-based audits of the quality system be performed at regular intervals to assure that it complies with the established quality requirements and to determine its effectiveness. It includes audit of the pharmacovigilance system which is covered by the quality system. The GVP Modules are applicable to EU-based companies and any company marketing medicinal products on a global basis. The legally required risk based audit strategy shall cover all PV processes and tasks undertaken by or delegated to other departments, MAH affiliates, and third parties such as distributors, external service providers, partners (the PV Universe). The PV Audit Strategy Plan is used to prepare the PV audit program, i.e. annual PV Audit Schedule.</P>
<P>In this two day workshop conference we will review the EMA and FDA requirements regarding Risk Based Audits of the PV system and Quality System. The course will focus on the design of the PV audit strategy, identification of the PV processes and entities subject to PV audit (define the PV audit universe), development of risk assessment methodology, development of procedures/tools to monitor PV processes and activities, and implementation of the PV audit strategy plan. Additionally, we will review methods of quality oversight and management of third parties performing PV activities..</P>

You aren’t alone. Roughly 30–35% of adults experience the symptoms of insomnia on a temporary basis. These symptoms include the inability to fall or stay asleep, fatigue during the day, mood disturbances, poor memory and the inability to focus. Meanwhile, up to 20% of adults experience longer-lasting insomnia (up to three months), while 10% have chronic and ongoing insomnia.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>The good news is cannabis can help you beat insomnia and enjoy a better night’s sleep. </SPAN><SPAN>Studies show that many patients report falling asleep easier and more quickly after consuming cannabis. In addition, cannabis can decrease episodes of sleep apnea, helping patients sleep more consistently throughout the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>HelloMD’s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Perry Solomon will speak with Chris Emerson, <SPAN>Ph.D</SPAN>, co-founder of Level, to share the “what” and the “how” of treating </SPAN><SPAN>insomnia </SPAN><SPAN>with cannabis. </SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Some of the questions we’ll cover in this workshop include:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>How does cannabis work within our bodies?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Why does cannabis work to alleviate insomnia?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>What part do cannabinoids play in the treatment of insomnia?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Why consume cannabis in lieu of pharmaceuticals?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>What cannabis products work best in the treatment of insomnia?</SPAN></LI>
<LI><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Do I need to be high in order to treat my insomnia?</SPAN></LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Chris Emerson has worked with folks </SPAN><SPAN>who suffer from insomnia across California</SPAN><SPAN>. Anecdotally, he’s seen the positive results that cannabis can provide. </SPAN></P>

We will start with setting up the environment using Vagrant, Python, Postgres, and Django while I help explain best practices for rapidly prototyping an API centric application. From there we will install the required Django plugins (such as Django Rest Framework), build the views and serializes, and handle user authentication. The next component will be dealing with image uploading, applying filters, and saving the data to a CDN capable location (S3). We’ll wrap up the project by creating all the other API endpoints such as getting profile info, liking, commenting, and following.

Each expression would commonly be a function that takes, along with common arguments, one or more proofs of propositions and returns a command that describes an alteration to the "constitution" itself (i.e., data describing a creation of a new expression, or an alteration/deletion of an existing one).</p> <p>Now, place this structure in a decentralized p2p network in the format of a blockchain, where each block contains calls to the expression set, thus providing instructions to alter itself.</p> <p>In Idris, this could be represented by a private data structure (which can't be created directly):</p> <p>data CoreCommand : Type where<br/>AlterCommand : {type : Type} -&gt; (namePath : NamePath) -&gt; (value : type) -&gt; CoreCommand<br/>DeleteCommand : (namePath : NamePath)</p> <p>where NamePath represents a canonical way to identify a named global expression and is defined as something like:</p> <p>NamePath : Type<br/>NamePath = List String</p> <p>This talk would discuss some ideas about:</p> <p>* A detailed description on how NomicChain could be built.<br/>* Potential uses for NomicChain. For example, how it could unify the fragmented market of cryptocurrencies, and creating a common service to provide security and communication.<br/>* The differences between so-called "Proof of Work", and "Proof of Stake", and why I think NomicChain should be initially be designed to work a neutral basis between the two.<br/>* Why I think that NomicChain should ultimately be built without a coin<br/>(this ties into the fragmentation of the cryptocurrency market).</p> <p>After this talk, I'm hoping for feedback as far as the implementation details, as well as the potential uses for a system such as this. I know the some of basics of type theory, but am an amateur at best, and would like to have opinions from others who are more familar with it.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ross-vovk-on-machine-learning-concepts-tickets-44433525872?aff=ebapi target=blank>Ross Vovk on Machine Learning Concepts</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> June 21, 2018</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P><SPAN>Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience.

This is mostly flat/level the whole way to Kent Lake, and the hike will be about 9 miles in total, there and back. So it is a very easy though long hike.</p> <p>We'll meet at the damn where Kent Pump Road begins:</p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bolinas+-+Fairfax+Rd,+Bolinas,+CA+94924/@37.940715,-122.638662,150m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x808594057bd64139:0x9c5c2b636c4ffad4!6m1!1e1" class="linkified">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bolinas+-+Fairfax+Rd,+Bolinas,+CA+94924/@37.940715,-122.638662,150m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x808594057bd64139:0x9c5c2b636c4ffad4!6m1!1e1</a></p> <p>Photo attached below is what the above map should show you of the meeting location (we meet at the blue marker).</p> <p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/d/7/600_460588375.jpeg" /></p> <p>And here's what that spot looks like from the road:</p> <p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/1/b/600_460588443.jpeg" /></p> <p>There is no parking lot so you just need to find spaces along Bolinas Road. There are more spaces across the dam as well.</p> <p>We will cancel for rain the morning of if necessary. We'll likely take the full time allotted, and I've moved the return time back a bit from our normal hikes because this one is so long. If it is imperative that you be back at your car before 4:30, please plan to depart from the group early or consider another hike.</p> <p>**PLEASE NOTE*** We/I have no idea if cells or GPS will work here, so please take the time to get directions (both what I wrote above and using "get directions" from google) and milage markers BEFORE you leave so that you can meet us at the designated place and time. Using google maps or GPS while on route results in some wonky, incorrect directions due to the sketchy reception for such devices in these remote areas. So again, it is best to get directions BEFORE you leave, at a place that has good internet access (such as a computer). We'll wait 10 to 15 minutes for everyone and then will begin the hike. Let me know if you have any questions.</p> <p>See you then!</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/develop-a-successful-bitcoin-startup-company-today-san-francisco-tickets-46460795490?aff=ebapi target=blank>Develop a Successful Bitcoin Startup Company Today!

While we can argue the merits NoSQL and have that endless debate of SQL vs NoSQL, we won't. Instead we want to do something totally different.</p> <p>In this months talk, our guest speaker Matthew D. Groves, Developer Advocate at Couchbase, will give us a look into NoSQL databases from a security standpoint. We'll look at security considerations, common mistakes developers make, and methods of prevention to ensure that your data remains secure. We look forward to seeing you there!</p> <p>Title: NoSQL Shouldn’t Mean NoSecurity</p> <p>Description: As NoSQL databases increase in popularity, they also increase in popularity with hackers. NoSQL databases are vulnerable to traditional attacks like SQL injection (yes, really). Further, the rush to productivity leaves some of these databases insecure-by-design. As a result, ransom notes have plagued databases like MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Hadoop, and CouchDB. This session demonstrates security mistakes and prevention. We’ll also look at what NoSQL vendors are doing to mitigate future attacks. Both devs and devops should come to this session, because the last thing either of you want to see is “SEND 0.2 BTC TO THIS ADDRESS 1zaGVjj9NcyvDLyYpCh33Msq TO RECOVER YOUR DATABASE!”</p> <p>Speaker:</p> <p>Matthew D. Groves<br/>Matthew is a guy who loves to code. It doesn't matter if it's C#, jQuery, or PHP: he'll submit pull requests for anything. He has been coding professionally ever since he wrote a QuickBASIC point-of-sale app for his parent's pizza shop back in the 90s. He currently works as a Developer Advocate for Couchbase. His free time is spent with his family, watching the Reds, and getting involved in the developer community. He is the author of AOP in .NET (published by Manning), and is also a Microsoft MVP.</p> <p>REGISTER HERE: <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2343832626848656129" class="linkified">https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2343832626848656129</a></p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/develop-a-successful-it-startup-company-today-san-francisco-tickets-43607897395?aff=ebapi target=blank>Develop a Successful IT Startup Company Today!

Data warehouses are used to consolidate data located in disparate databases. A data warehouse stores large quantities of data by specific categories so it can be more easily retrieved, interpreted, and sorted by users. Warehouses enable executives and managers to work with vast stores of transactional or other data to respond faster to markets and make more informed business decisions. It has been predicted that every business will have a data warehouse within ten years. But merely storing data in a data warehouse does a company little good. Companies will want to learn more about that data to improve knowledge of customers and markets. The company benefits when meaningful trends and patterns are extracted from the data.</P>

Hanah is passionate about accessibility and approachability in education and spends time contributing to GDI’s open source curriculum. She is stoked to be moderating this panel.</p> <p>Alyssa Kwan is a long-time open source contributor to a variety of projects, from programming languages and compilers to core backend services.

Over the past 4 years, she has been building out data teams from scratch. She has long had limited time to contribute to open source, so she is keenly focused on maximizing the impact of her time spent, and is highly selective in how she invests her time.</p> <p>Liz Howard is an engineer and manager of 16 years. Liz has been a teacher at Girl Develop It since 2012, where she got started with open-source contribution, and she has been contributing to open-source ever since. After she got started teaching with Girl Develop It, she helped found Hackbright Academy, and built engineering courses at Tradecraft and Galvanize. Now she's the CTO at Enki.com. She maintains an open-source computer science and programming curriculum, where new open-source contributors can get started: <a href="https://github.com/enkidevs/curriculum" class="linkified">https://github.com/enkidevs/curriculum</a></p> <p>Truc Nguyen is a engineer by training turned generalist designer. She is a Senior Product Designer with a technical bent at Unity Technologies. She first got started contributing to open source through creating new curriculum for Girl Develop It and is now a maintainer for GDI SF's teaching-materials.org repo.

For this event, we have invited speakers from different companies and tech communities to talk about their personal journey into data science and beyond and share some lessons they've learned along the way.</p> <p>6:00 Doors open<br/>6:30 Welcome from WiMLDS, PyLadies SF, DoorDash<br/>6:40 Talks by Melanie Warrick, Kasia Rachuta, Raquel Araujo<br/>8:00 Panel discussion with the speakers and invited guests, socializing<br/>9:00 Doors close</p> <p>Speakers and invited panelists:</p> <p>Melanie Warrick is a Developer Relations Engineer for AI and the Cloud at Google and speaks a lot about AI and ML. She was a founding engineer on a deep learning platform prior to Google and worked on machine learning engineering at Change.org. In another life she had a comprehensive consulting career, as an IC and leading teams both domestic and international and before that she was working behind the scenes in the film industry. In her spare time, she sleeps.</p> <p>Kasia Rachuta works as a Data Scientist at Medium. She has a Master’s in theoretical physics from University College London. In her spare time, she enjoys volunteering for women-related organizations and diversity causes, scuba diving and traveling.</p> <p>Raquel Araujo works at Indeed as a Product Scientist in the Applicant Quality team after working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. After trying to be an Economics PhD student, she found a job in analytics and never looked back.</p> <p>Jessica Lachs is the Head of Analytics at DoorDash. Jessica and the team are responsible for all things data including product analytics, business analytics, business intelligence, and data science. Prior to DoorDash, Jessica was the founder and CEO of GiftSimple, a social gifting startup. She began her career in investment banking, spending over 3 years at Lehman Brother in NYC. Jessica holds a BS from Cornell, and an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Grishma Jena is a Cognitive Software Engineer with Data Science for Marketing at IBM Watson. She volunteers at the San Francisco Public Library and has mentored high school students on Artificial Intelligence as part of the non-profit AI4ALL.</p> <p>Paula Alves is a Data Scientist with Digisight, where she works with healthcare data in the production team. She learned Python for fun and turned a hobby into a career, starting with consulting. Previously, she was a geoscientist specialized in mineral processing research and development.</p> <p>Talk 1: Tech career path advice (Melanie Warrick)<br/>I've worked in many companies and industries and my path into technology has not been a straight line. I am sharing what I've experienced developing my career and advice that has helped me get where I am now. The goal is to get you thinking about your career paths in ways you haven't considered.</p> <p>Talk 2: From physics to data science - a numbers journey (Kasia Rachuta)<br/>Prior to starting my career in tech, I worked for the UK equivalent of the National Science Foundation; completed a couple of internships in social impact measurement and volunteered in Spain, Kenya and London. After I finished my master's, I decided to try something new and that's how I found myself in data science. I will cover being self-taught, what resources have helped me get where I am, as well as touch on the importance of mentorship and advocating for yourself.</p> <p>Talk 3: What I learned from every job I held and how that shaped who I am today (Raquel Araujo)<br/>My journey into data science was not a typical one. But whose is it, anyway? When I was looking for a job in a tech company, I had to market myself as ready for the industry after spending several years in academia. I had to learn to navigate whiteboard interviews, homework assignments, coding challenges. I want to share what I learned from every step in my career with people who may find themselves in a similar situation.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/WriteSpeakCode-SFBay/events/248124454/ target=blank>Write/Speak/Code: Write About It</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> June 26, 2018</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Note: This meetup is only for coders who identify as a woman or non-binary.</p> <p>:::: Write About It ::::</p> <p>Let's get together and get some writing done!

<P><SPAN>Data lakes are centralized data repositories.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN> Data needed by data scientists is physically copied to a data lake which serves as a one storage environment. This way, data scientists can access all the data from only one entry point – a one-stop shop to get the right data.

You will then be sent an eNDA which needs to be signed 24 hours before the event, for security reasons. A badge would be pre-printed for you when you arrive at the event. Please register here.</p> <p>Talk #1: Foundations of streaming SQL or: How I learned to love stream and table theory</p> <p>This talk will address all of those questions in two parts.<br/>First, we’ll explore the relationship between the Beam Model (as described in The Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 blog posts) and stream &amp; table theory (as popularized by Martin Kleppmann and Jay Kreps, etc., but essentially originating out of the database world).</p> <p>Second, we’ll apply our clear understanding of that relationship towards explaining what is required to provide robust stream processing support in SQL. We’ll discuss concrete efforts that have been made in this area by the Apache Beam, Calcite, and Flink communities, compare to other offerings such as Kafka KSQL &amp; Spark Structured streaming, and talk about new ideas yet to come.</p> <p>In the end, you can expect to have a much better understanding of the key concepts underpinning data processing, regardless of whether that data processing batch or streaming, SQL or programmatic, as well as a concrete notion of what robust stream processing in SQL looks like.</p> <p>Speaker: Tyler Akidau(Google)<br/>Tyler Akidau is a staff software engineer at Google Seattle. He leads technical infrastructure’s internal data processing teams (MillWheel &amp; Flume), is a founding member of the Apache Beam PMC, and has spent the last seven years working on massive-scale data processing systems. He is the author of the 2015 Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 articles on the O’Reilly website. His preferred mode of transportation is by cargo bike, with his two young daughters in tow.</p> <p>Talk #2: Kinesis at Lyft</p> <p>This talk will focus on how we used Amazon Kinesis to build the pub-sub infra at Lyft, that ingests more than a 100 billion events per day. We'll review the strengths and weaknesses of Kinesis as a choice for streaming events in realtime, at Lyft's scale; as well as the best practices and lessons learnt over time.</p> <p>Speaker: Hafiz Hamid (Lyft)</p> <p>Hafiz Hamid is a software engineer on the Pub-Sub/Streaming Platform team at Lyft. He has built some of the key pieces in the messaging &amp; streaming infrastructure at Lyft. Previously, Hafiz was a technical lead at Bing Search where he worked on data pipelines, relevance and web crawlers.</p> <p>Talk #3: Data all over the place! How Apache Calcite brings SQL and sanity to streaming and spatial data</p> <p>The revolution has happened. We are living the age of the deconstructed database. The modern enterprises are powered by data, and that data lives in many formats and locations, in-flight and at rest, but somewhat surprisingly, the lingua franca for remains SQL. In this talk, Julian describes Apache Calcite, a toolkit for relational algebra that powers many systems including Apache Beam, Flink and Hive. He discusses some areas of development in Calcite: streaming SQL, materialized views, enabling spatial query on vanilla databases, and what a mash-up of all three might look like.</p> <p>Speaker: Julian Hyde (Looker)</p> <p>Julian Hyde is an expert in query optimization and in-memory analytics. He founded Apache Calcite, a framework for query optimization and data virtualization. He also founded Mondrian, the popular open source OLAP engine, and co-founded SQLstream, an early streaming SQL platform.

<P CLASS="description-left">GxP/GMP regulations are required to be used in regulated industries such as food and beverages, pharmaceutical, medical devices, and cosmetics.Documentation is a critical tool for ensuring GxP/GMP compliance. In order to maintain documentation in GxP/GMP compliant manner, information governance should be developed and implemented.Change control within quality management systems (QMS) and information technology (IT) systems is a formal process used to ensure that changes to a product or system are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner. In the regulated industries, manufactures are required to use a change control procedure.Data security is the high priority in any organization but especially in a regulated industry. E-Discovery preparedness makes it imperative for organizations to develop an enterprise wide strategy to manage the volume of electronic information. The discovery process affects many individuals in an organization, not just lawyers and others involved in discovery, but also IT professionals and records managers who have to be prepared to produce electronic content for discovery and litigation.Crisis preparedness is the high priority in any organization but especially in a regulated industry.</P>

<DIV>Big data and analytics applications require storage that can scale in capacity and performance to handle workload demands with high throughput to compute nodes coupled with read-after-write consistency and low-latency file operations. Many analytics workloads interact with data via a file interface, rely on file semantics such as file locks, and require the ability to write to portions of a file. Amazon EFS provides the elasticity and agility to scale for analytics workloads. In this technical session, we will dive deep and discuss technical considerations when deploying analytics on EFS, with a focus on SAS Grid, a shared, centrally managed analytics computing environment. We will describe best practices and discuss tips for success.</DIV>

<P><STRONG>How does Career Day work? </STRONG>Once you arrive &amp; register at check-in, you'll receive a resume book that features each of our graduating data scientists. This should serve as your guide for the evening, allowing you to review each graduate's resume &amp; profile, as well as jot down notes so you can remember whom you'd like to meet during the networking portion. The Metis team will then give a brief welcome &amp; explanation of the evening, and then our graduates will begin their final project presentations. After presentations, we will break into a networking hour where employers (you) are encouraged to meet the graduates. The goal is to connect you with potential candidates for your open data science jobs.</P>

Yet this city is also home to one of the largest populations of people experiencing homelessness in North America. More than 7,000 people are recognized as homeless in San Francisco, living in either temporary shelters or on the street.</P>
<P><A HREF="https://sheltertech.org/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">ShelterTech</A> is a non-profit organisation founded by former homeless Darcel Jackson that develops digital solutions for homeless and underserved communities.</P>
<P>As he was experiencing homelessness, Darcel Jackson realized he had access to a smartphone but found that getting info about services available for people experiencing homelessness was extremely difficult - there were no products designed for the homeless. So he gathered a team of volunteers to build it! </P>
<P><SPAN>ShelterTech team aims to build the most reliable, up-to-date online database of services available to homeless and underserved communities in San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P><STRONG>That's where we need you! We are running volunteer workshops, called Datathons, with the goal of vetting the accuracy and quality of the data. </STRONG></P>
<P>During this Datathon, you'll work side-by-side with Community Representatives -- people who are currently or have previously been homeless -- to verify information and make sure the 500+ services in our system are correct.<STRONG> This is a great way to learn about some of the struggles faced by people experiencing homelessness and have an immediate impact in helping them.</STRONG></P>
<P>Come join us, learn more about homelessness in SF and have an immediate impact! </P>
